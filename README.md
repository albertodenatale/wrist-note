Stop taking note on your wrist! 

This project aims to provide wrist users with a light and quick to use note-taking app. Long-term objectives include having this app ready to export notes to other more robust note-taking apps (such as OneNote), plus creating a REST web service able to track sessions and keep data live.

This project uses Apache Cordova and jQuery.

Currently the app is downloadable at https://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/store/p/wrist-note/9nblggh43mfn
